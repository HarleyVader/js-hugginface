“Generate a Node.js server script using Express, HTTP, Socket.IO, and worker threads. The server should listen on port 6969 and serve static files from a ‘public’ directory and images from an ‘images’ directory. When a GET request is made to the ‘/images’ endpoint, the server should read the ‘images’ directory and send an HTML response containing all the images in the directory. When a client connects to the server via Socket.IO, a new worker thread should be created and event listeners should be set up to handle ‘query’ and ‘disconnect’ events. When a ‘query’ event is received, the server should perform some computation in the worker thread and send the result back to the client. When a ‘disconnect’ event is received, the associated worker thread should be terminated.”


“Generate a worker script in Node.js using the ‘dotenv’, ‘node-fetch’, and ‘worker_threads’ modules. The script should listen for ‘message’ events from the parent thread. When a ‘message’ event is received, the script should log the received data, perform a query using the received data, and post the result back to the parent thread. If an error occurs during the query, the script should log the error and post an error message back to the parent thread. The query function should make a POST request to ‘https://mff03nee2jrxc40h.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud’ with the received data as the request body and ‘application/json’ as the ‘Accept’ and ‘Content-Type’ headers. The function should log the received result from Hugging Face and return it.”


“Generate a client-side JavaScript script that uses Socket.IO for real-time communication with a server. The script should define a function ‘autoExpand’ that adjusts the height of a given element based on its scroll height and border width. It should also define a function ‘sendMessage’ that gets values from form fields, creates a parameters object, gets the value of a textarea, creates a data object, and emits a ‘query’ event to the server with the data object. The script should also define an event listener for ‘data’ events from the server that creates a new paragraph element, sets its text to the server’s response, and appends it to a container. Finally, the script should add an event listener to a form that prevents the form from submitting normally and calls the ‘sendMessage’ function when the form is submitted.”
